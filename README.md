# Tableau-Datasource-Auditor
Audits a directory structure of Tableau workbooks (packaged and normal) for items of interest.

### Primary Purpose
Level of Detail expressions are costly from a performance perspective - we're looking to make sure there are as few as possible *nested* LOD expressions to keep performance in check.
